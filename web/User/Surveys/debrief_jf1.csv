Thank you for participating in our study. 
We were interested in examining how self-reported social networking and alcohol addiction (as well as individual differences) predict attentional biases towards these stimuli 
in a visual probe task. Attentional biases refer to initial orienting of attention to the alcohol and social networking stimuli, and how long it takes to disengage from these 
stimuli. This was recorded using the eye-tracking equipment. <br><br>
